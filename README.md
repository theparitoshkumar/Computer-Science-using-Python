# Computer-Science-using-Python
This repository is a collection of Python code and resources for learning Computer Science concepts. The code is organized into different topics, such as data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more.

Each topic folder contains one or more Python scripts or notebooks that demonstrate the concepts and provide examples. The scripts are designed to be interactive, so you can modify the code and see the results in real-time.

The resources folder includes links to articles, videos, and books that are helpful for learning Computer Science with Python. The resources are organized by topic and level, so you can find what you need quickly.

This repository is perfect for beginners who are just starting to learn Computer Science with Python or for more experienced developers who want to refresh their knowledge. Feel free to contribute to the repository by adding your own scripts or resources, or by suggesting improvements to existing code.
